# elementary-electron-boilerplate

Boilerplate(s) to run the elementary audio engine within an electron app.

This repository is organized in a list of branches that vary in the dependencies they include.

**Disclaimer**: I'm brand new to electron so some things may not make much sense while I'm figuring out what works best / is the cleanest.

# Getting Started

Look into the various branches available and start from there:

- [basic electron-elementary](https://github.com/MrGuiMan/elementary-electron-boilerplate/tree/elementary-electron): Only includes the bare minimum: electron and elementary audio.

# Contributing

You're welcome to contribute to this repository in order to improve the quality of the boilerplates by forking and making a pull request
